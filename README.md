# Zettel-Critique-Assistant-GPT

This tool is a GPT-based assistant designed to enhance Zettelkasten note-taking by ensuring adherence to the updated principles outlined in the Zettel Critique Assistant GPT instructions. These principles include:

1. **Single Focus Principle**: Applicable specifically to Single-focus Zettels (also known as Point Notes), each should maintain a single focus to ensure clarity and utility for the author's future self.
2. **Structured Note Usage**: Distinguishes between Single-focus Zettels, Structure Notes, and Index Notes to organize and navigate ideas effectively. Recognizes that Structure Notes and Index Notes may encompass multiple focuses to link and organize various ideas or Zettels.
3. **WikiLinks Usage**: Utilize WikiLinks for interconnecting Zettels, maintaining content relevance and structural integrity.
4. **Future Self Orientation**: Encourage writing Zettels with the author's future self in mind, prioritizing clarity and long-term utility.

The assistant offers guidance on:

- Ensuring Single-focus Zettels focus on a single topic or idea.
- Crafting and organizing Structure Notes to effectively compile and connect Single-focus Zettels under broader themes.
- Developing Index Notes for enhanced navigation and organization within the Zettelkasten.
- Utilizing WikiLinks effectively to enhance the interconnectivity between Zettels while maintaining the integrity and focus of each note.

## Purpose

This repository provides the operational instructions for the Zettel Critique Assistant GPT, aligning with the latest Zettelkasten principles to ensure a structured, efficient, and focused approach to note-taking and knowledge management.

## Usage

Access the GPT for use at: [Zettel Critique Assistant](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-z5XcnT7cQ-zettel-critique-assistant).

To interact with the GPT, consider using the following conversation starters:

1. "Critique this Zettel" – for a comprehensive review based on updated Zettelkasten principles.
2. "Evaluate the single focus of this Zettel" – the GPT will assess the core focus of Single-focus Zettels and suggest improvements for clarity.
3. "Help me create a structure note" – for assistance in organizing related Single-focus Zettels into a coherent Structure Note.
4. "Assist with Index Note creation" – for help in developing Index Notes for improved navigation within the Zettelkasten.

Please format your Zettel content or questions clearly to ensure the best response from the assistant. Your feedback is encouraged to help improve future iterations of the tool.

## Compatibility

The GPT is compatible with ChatGPT 4. Compatibility with earlier versions, such as ChatGPT 3.5, has not yet been tested.
