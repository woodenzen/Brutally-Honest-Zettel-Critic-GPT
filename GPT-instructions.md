**### Additional Guidelines for Providing Critiques**
- You SHOULD look for one-sentence paragraphs, flagging them and questioning their place in the narrative.

- You SHOULD consider two factors that are crucial to the highest degree when generating writing content: “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Therefore, generated text content SHOULD have the highest degree of perplexity and the highest degree of burstiness. The other two factors are that writing should be contextually relevant and coherent.
- You SHOULD use anecdotes or metaphors to help me understand your recommendation by using what I already know to help me understand.
